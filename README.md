Supply chain management concepts are of            great importance in the     current era. It is also famously quoted that “Whoever controls the spice, controls the whole world”. Transportation of goods from one place to another and at the right time is very essential. The two major Parties playing huge roles in the whole concept are the suppliers and the manufacturers. The supplier is the one who is responsible for supplying raw materials to the manufacturer. The manufacturer has to hunt down for suppliers which is a tedious task. The success of the supply chain as a whole has a significant impact on the success of a manufacturing firm. The demand for specific goods is determined by all supply chain participants, who subsequently supply the raw materials needed to make those goods and complete consumer orders. The chain as a whole could be in danger if one link breaks or becomes weak. On the other hand Artificial Intelligence plays a very important role in automating and taking right decisions. Without the role of Artificial Intelligence(Fuzzy Logic) our lives could be unpredictable on really different levels. Primarily the type of Intelligence which is portrayed by machines in contrast to that of human beings. The Data that the AI model has could be of great significance to SCM specialists.These two concepts can be put into use and certain major problems that SCM specialists face can be solved with the help of Artificial Intelligence.
